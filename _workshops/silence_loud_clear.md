In life, some of the most profound, moving or hilarious experiences play out in total silence. In this workshop, we will learn to lean on that familiar human state - silence - on the stage, discovering it’s unique theatrical power.

This workshop is not directed towards mime, or even necessarily physicality, but rather the dramatic and comedic impact of not speaking, and all the actions, realisations and stories that rush in to fill space when we’re brave enough to leave it empty. During the workshop, we will cycle through the myriad of ways silence can be utilised to make offers, ground scenes, heighten emotions, develop the game and connect with the audience.

Level: all levels.

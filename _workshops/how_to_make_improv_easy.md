The easiest way to improvise it to speak from a moment of truth, and connect on emotions. This workshop teaches you how easy it can be to connect with your scene partner on positive emotions. We’ll be working on heavily agreeing and learn to look for our “and” in the “yes, and”.
This workshop is heavily inspired by Stefan working together with Jason Shotts auditing his workshops for more than 6 weeks.

Level: intermediate, advanced.

OK, so our scene has led us into the perfect moment for a song. Great. What happens next? What makes a great song?
In this workshop we'll look at how to create songs ‘organically’— by playing and experimenting, gradually discovering a brilliant theme and musical hook.

We'll look at:

- what songs are about
- how to explore and find a theme and perspective
- how to know when you've found all that you need, and when you should change

This session won’t require anyone to know the details of song structures or musical techniques. It’s therefore ideal to people who enjoy singing (maybe just in the shower), but haven’t done much musical improv. On the other hand, experienced improvisers can also find the novel approach interesting.

Level: all levels but not complete improv beginners.

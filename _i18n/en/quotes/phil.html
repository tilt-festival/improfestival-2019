    <p>“The Tilt Festival is a high-intensity blast of fun - which, as we know, is fun - and creativity - which is also fun, as Tilt proves over and over again. Eighteen performances and eighteen workshops packed into three days; dozens of improvisers from all over the world; it's a blast. Oh, and Tallinn is wonderful too. Go.”

The seventh international improv festival Tilt takes place on 19-21 September in Tallinn! Improv differs from classical theatre in that the entire performance is invented on the spot, inspired from suggestions given by the audience. Every performance is unique and will never be seen again, because it's not possible to improvise the same story twice. Tilt brings you the best improv actors and teachers from Estonia and all over the world!

This year it is also possible to buy the Tilt Supporters Pass. The Supporters Pass is meant for the most dedicated fans of improv who have already planned these three nights well in advance to see all the shows in this yearâ€™s festival. But the owner of this pass is not just a fan of improv but he or she is also a fan of the festival Tilt and feels that this event is important in improv scene both locally and globally. Thanks to this noble person the organisers of the festival can feel moral support and encouragement in making the festival happen as well as real support in paying the bills of the festival. And also maybe get one extra cup of coffee.

We thank you!

Tilt Supporters Pass costs 140 euros.

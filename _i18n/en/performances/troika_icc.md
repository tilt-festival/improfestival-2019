## Troika (LVA/RUS) - “Journey”

In English

We all make choices every day, big or small, and they all take us on a journey.

After getting a suggestion from the audience about a decision or choice they've made in their life (big or small) the actors are inspired to explore a character (or characters) stories.
This decision can be the pivot point, or it can be the instigator, the beginning or the end, because it isn't so much about the destination, it's more about the journey.

Troika was an idea that formed back at TILT in 2017 where Anna, Kaspars and Josh first met. After that clandestine meeting, they knew they had to perform together so they created Troika.
They came up with the name Troika, meaning a Russian vehicle drawn by three horses, to represent how the trio of them met and bonded over their shared experiences.
Troika, as a vehicle, allows these three improvisers to explore characters and choices they take while taking you on the journey with them.

## Jaa !mproteater ja Improkutsikad (EST) - “Maestro”

In Estonian

Maestro is a world-famous improv format that was created by Keith Johnstone. We’re honoured to bring it to stage first time in Estonia having a group of improvisers in different age and knowledge challenge each other finding the Maestro of this evening. The winner is decided with the help of the audience and of course, it’s always important to have good relationships with Fortuna as well. You’re all welcome to find your favourites and cheer to their performance!

Jaa !mprov theatre has brought good short- and long-form improvisation to the audience for already ten seasons. Improv puppies is a group of young improvisers who started doing improv four years ago in Rahumäe Põhikool. Together they form a symbiosis with a unique dynamic where experiences and energy are exchanged in multiple ways and everyone has something to learn.

The sixth international improv festival Tilt takes place on 20-22 September in Tallinn! Improv
differs from classical theatre in that the entire performance is invented on the spot, inspired
from suggestions given by the audience. Every performance is unique and will never be
seen again, because it&#39;s not possible to improvise the same story twice. Tilt brings you the
best improv actors and teachers from Estonia and all over the world!

Instead of buying tickets one by one it’s also possible to buy a festival pass that makes
seeing performances cheaper than when buying full price tickets. The number of festival
passes is limited.

Tilt Festival Pass costs 60 euros.

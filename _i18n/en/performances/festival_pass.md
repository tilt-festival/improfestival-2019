The seventh international improv festival Tilt takes place on 19-21 September in Tallinn! Improv differs from classical theatre in that the entire performance is invented on the spot, inspired from suggestions given by the audience. Every performance is unique and will never be seen again, because it's not possible to improvise the same story twice. Tilt brings you the best improv actors and teachers from Estonia and all over the world!

Instead of buying tickets one by one itâ€™s also possible to buy a festival pass that makes seeing performances cheaper than when buying full price tickets. The number of festival passes is limited.

Tilt Festival Pass costs 75 euros.

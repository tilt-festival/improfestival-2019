Sander Aleks Paavo is in his last year studying lighting design at Viljandi Culture Academy and in addition he works at Ugala theatre as a lighting technician/designer. On a daily basis, he focuses on lights and running the shows, but occasionally he gets to do lighting designs for the shows as well. Besides working as a lighting designer for theatre, he has also done lighting to many dance performances and flashed lights on concerts. 

Improv and the festival TILT got hold of him thanks to his wife, Mari-Riin, who had been the head technician of the festival previously. This year, while wifey is dealing with social media, Sander is the boss of lights and sound.

Some time ago Sander also attended acting department at the university, so even though he didn't graduate as an actor, he knows very well what it means and feels like to be on the stage and how lights can manipulate with the performer. He is a fan of improv and enjoys supporting the performers, influencing the audience and being part of the show while sitting comfortably behind the lighting console.

In addition to working with lights, Sander really enjoys handicrafts. He is currently building up an old cottage house!

They help us to enrich our comedy without falling into sexist clichés and crude humor. In this workshop, we’ll explore these impulses.</p><p>You’ll learn to feel more secure with them, to make sexual offers without overstepping boundaries and to deal with offers that make you feel uncomfortable without ending the scene. You’ll become more aware of yourself and your partners so you can take care of each other and overcome possible fears and shame together.</p><p>Being more comfortable with sexuality in improv will give you more strength and freedom as an improviser and empowers you as a person!</p><p>Level: intermediate, advanced.</p><hr><p>Sophia Lierenfeld is an actress, improviser, musician and coach based in Berlin.

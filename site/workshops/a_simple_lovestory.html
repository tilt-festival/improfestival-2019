Because of love and fear we can cross our boundaries.</p><p>In this workshop, we will focus on Normal People. Using the reality. Love, lack of love, bitterness, dreams, fears. On what hides inside of us and others, what drives us, and what we can do to get what we desire. And how to express your feelings on stage, so they won’t end at „Hi Honey”, five meters from each other.</p><p>Why? Because the audience wants to engage, feel something, and not only laugh. And they feel when we touch the Truth. Because a simple love story has a bigger power than the battle of wizards at the top of Mount Everest.</p><p>Level: intermediate.</p><hr><p>Małgorzata Różalska (Gosia/Róża) – improviser and teacher from the north of Poland.

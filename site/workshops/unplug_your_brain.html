We will train not to be heady or too rational, to allow your scenes to be silly, to accept and play the nonsense. Let your bodies surprise yourself and embrace their strong propositions, to just have fun, play like kids, discover new places, characters and relations, to follow the inspiration and your instinct.</p><p>Level: beginners to advanced.</p><hr><p>When Dan started theater at 9, he knew right away that he wanted to do it all his life. It became even more obvious when he discovered improv in Strasbourg in 2007. That year he joined the Lolita. In 2011, he became a professional. He had the chance that year to participate in the marathon of improv (7 days di’mpro 24H / 24). In 2012, with his best friends, he created La Carpe Haute. Together, they do everything: shows, training, corporate events… He teaches since 2011 in weekly classes, and the group opened their improv school in 2017.</p><p>In 2014, he participated for the first time in an international improv festival in Denmark. Since then, he has played and taught in New York, Amsterdam, Berlin, Bydgoszcz, London, Oslo, Barcelona, etc. It is in these festivals that he rediscovered all the possibilities offered by the improvisation, the totally silent show, free form, costumed shows or musicals…</p><p>What he loves especially in improv is the connection between the partners, the sincerity and the playfulness. That’s what makes him vibrate, what takes him! He remains an improv nerd, all styles and all types of show can make him happy. And that’s what he loves the most, that the journey is infinite!</p><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.com/origamiswanimpro" target="_blank">facebook.com/origamiswanimpro</a></li><li><a href="https://lacarpehaute.com" target="_blank">lacarpehaute.com</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/Lacarpehaute" target="_blank">facebook.com/Lacarpehaute</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>

With TILT she has grown since the first festival in 2013.</p><p>So far, she was the head technician, managing sound and lights for the shows. This year Mari-Riin wanted to have a different approach, to actually SEE the shows, but not from behind the lighting console. She does have some experience in the social media field, but she will go by the motto “I’ll improvise!”</p><p>Improv found Mari-Riin and she found Improv, through the main organiser Rahel, when they started IMPROving the collaboration between actors and technicians. Young lighting designer now finds it fascinating that the technical team is so involved during the show. Being an improv technician, either sound or light, you have to think along, even think ahead! One needs to stay alert.</p><p>In addition to the festival TILT, she already has worked in several bigger theatres in Estonia and done many lightning designs for shows (drama, dance, concerts etc.).</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>

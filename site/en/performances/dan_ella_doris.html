In the Japanese art of origami, a single piece of paper contains a world of possibilities, with each fold guiding the material towards its final form. Yet even as it stands completed, the origami swan still holds within it the possibilities of what might have been. In Origami Swan, Ella Galt (BIG, Barcelona) and Dan Seyfried (La Carpe Haute, Strasbourg) present an intimate theatrical exploration of quantum multiverse theory, in which every choice you’ve ever made and never made exist in an unimaginably vast ensemble of parallel universes. As the reach of our possible worlds unfolds before us, we discover that the decisions we make are at once intensely powerful, and totally meaningless.</p><hr><p>Dan and Ella met in Barcelona, during BIG IF 2, a few years ago. They are both professional actors and improvisers in BIG (Barcelona, Spain) for Ella and in La Carpe Haute (Strasbourg, France) for Dan. They first played as a duo when a Polish festival (Podaj Wioslo, Gdansk 2018) challenged them to create a new format based on a name people on Facebook gave to them. They discovered that they love to play together and that’s how their duo and show, Origami Swan, was born! Oh, and they love playing loud birds…</p><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.com/origamiswanimpro" target="_blank">facebook.com/origamiswanimpro</a></li></ul><h2 id="doris-likes-everything-fin---loser-circus">Doris Likes Everything (FIN) - “Loser Circus”</h2><p>In English</p><p>Loser Circus is an improvised narrative story that takes place in the golden ages of travelling circuses. It’s a show that brings the heartwarming feel of a classic underdog story together with the rush and valour of the live acts that can only happen inside a circus ring. And a sneak peek, if you will, into the whimsical yet hard life that starts when the curtains are closed.</p><hr><p>Doris Likes Everything has nearly 30 years of combined improv experience and they are all keen on learning new skills, pushing themselves and each other to the next level and even beyond. Now they have already performed together in three different countries and Doris Likes Everything has formed itself into the perfect combination of dorkiness and coolness. They take their projects seriously but always with a heartful idiotism as a spice.</p><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.com/dorislikeseverything" target="_blank">facebook.com/dorislikeseverything</a></li><li><a href="https://instagram.com/dorislikeseverything" target="_blank">instagram.com/dorislikeseverything</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>

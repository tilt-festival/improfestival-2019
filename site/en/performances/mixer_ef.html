Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of the workshop instructor, they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening. So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!</p><h2 id="no-lyrics-the-sonic-piece-instructor-stacey-smith-usa">“No Lyrics: The Sonic Piece!”. Instructor: Stacey Smith (USA)</h2><p>In English</p><p>We sing when there are no words left to say. But what about when our lyrics are taken away? The show zooms in on sonic exploration and you will see how the performers will heighten their emotions to create musical pieces that have no words.</p><h2 id="portmanteau-instructor-phil-whelans-gbr">“Portmanteau”. Instructor: Phil Whelans (GBR)</h2><p>In English</p><p>Three or four characters - some, none or all of whom know each other - are in a location (quite possibly one suggested by the audience). And there they stay - voluntarily or otherwise - for the whole show. And the interaction of these three or four could be a show in itself. But it isn’t.</p><p>During the course of their time together, each character tells a story, and each story comes to life on stage, before we return to the central narrative - our characters in our location. The stories can be autobiographical, real, fantastical or none of the above. They can change the characters in the “meta” story and therefore feed that story. Or not. It’s all up for grabs. That’s right; it’s a Portmanteau.</p></div></div></div></body></html>

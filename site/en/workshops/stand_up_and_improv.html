As an improviser, sometimes making a joke might kill the story. As a stand-up comedian, it is scary to leave your fixed set and improvise with the audience and still be funny. In this workshop, we touch two worlds. Two worlds that might look opposing from the outside but feel really good from the inside.</p><p>Level: best for improvisers who also want to try stand-up or comedians that want to learn to loosen up.</p><hr><p>Jeron Dewulf is a professional improviser and a stand up comedian. He has 27 years of improv and 12 years of stand up experience that he will share with you. He has no secrets and will try to teach you everything he knows.

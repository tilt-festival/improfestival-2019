SUMMARY:Fiendish Plotting
DESCRIPTION:It’s nice to hear laughter from an audience but how often do we hear them gasp – “How did she know the key would be missing?” – or not hear them at all because they’re holding their breath with the unbearable tension of it all? Can we be more ambitious with our plotting? How can we make plot connections through which we look not just clever, but attractive and popular*?Using whatever we find in the long-form narrative toolbox, we’ll loosen, then tighten again, the nuts and bolts of story.*Class may not make you look attractive and popular. Terms and Conditions apply.Level: intermediate, advanced.Phil has been improvising for 30 years, starting out with Theatresports at the Donmar Warehouse, Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh and Glasgow Mayfest, then, subsequently, in Toronto, Seattle, San Francisco and at Montreal’s Just for Laughs Comedy Festival for CBCTV.He was in T.V. and radio pilots, Gibberish (Celador T.V.) and Altered Egos (Radio 4.)

UID:/workshops/trust_your_sexuality
LOCATION:Raekoja plats 18
SUMMARY:Trust Your Sexuality
DESCRIPTION:In improv we learn to trust our impulses - but what about the flirty, sexual ones?We need them to play truthful and intimate love stories, to create more vulnerable and honest characters. They help us to enrich our comedy without falling into sexist clichés and crude humor.In this workshop, we’ll explore these impulses.You’ll learn to feel more secure with them, to make sexual offers without overstepping boundaries and to deal with offers that make you feel uncomfortable without ending the scene. You’ll become more aware of yourself and your partners so you can take care of each other and overcome possible fears and shame together.Being more comfortable with sexuality in improv will give you more strength and freedom as an improviser and empowers you as a person!Level: intermediate, advanced.Sophia Lierenfeld is an actress, improviser, musician and coach based in Berlin. She performs and teaches improv internationally with her groups “Fox and Foxy” and “Birthday Cake” and various other improv projects.

She used improvisation to develop and stage over 30 plays with kids and teenagers and worked as a musical director for the youth section of the state theatre in Nuremberg.Playing for and with children is still an important part of her life. Sophia worked as an actress in fairy tales at Galli Theater Berlin for over a year and now travels to book fares and goes on theatre tours for a big book publisher, telling the stories of Janosch, a famous German illustrator and children’s books author.Besides her theatre and music work, Sophia is also a dating coach and helps people to become more authentic, playful and happy and truly connect with each other.

LOCATION:Vene tn 6, Tallinn, Estonia
SUMMARY:Unplug Your Brain
DESCRIPTION:Our brain is a formidable machine to create and imagine, but sometimes it’s our own trap, our only barrier.This workshop aims at unplugging our brains, to explore what our bodies have to suggest. We will train not to be heady or too rational, to allow your scenes to be silly, to accept and play the nonsense. Let your bodies surprise yourself and embrace their strong propositions, to just have fun, play like kids, discover new places, characters and relations, to follow the inspiration and your instinct.Level: beginners to advanced.When Dan started theater at 9, he knew right away that he wanted to do it all his life. It became even more obvious when he discovered improv in Strasbourg in 2007. That year he joined the Lolita. In 2011, he became a professional. He had the chance that year to participate in the marathon of improv (7 days di’mpro 24H / 24). In 2012, with his best friends, he created La Carpe Haute. Together, they do everything: shows, training, corporate events… He teaches since 2011 in weekly classes, and the group opened their improv school in 2017.In 2014, he participated for the first time in an international improv festival in Denmark. Since then, he has played and taught in New York, Amsterdam, Berlin, Bydgoszcz, London, Oslo, Barcelona, etc. It is in these festivals that he rediscovered all the possibilities offered by the improvisation, the totally silent show, free form, costumed shows or musicals…What he loves especially in improv is the connection between the partners, the sincerity and the playfulness. That’s what makes him vibrate, what takes him! He remains an improv nerd, all styles and all types of show can make him happy. And that’s what he loves the most, that the journey is infinite!  facebook.com/origamiswanimpro  lacarpehaute.com  facebook.com/Lacarpehaute

SUMMARY:“Bonnie & Clyde” & “The Dropthrough”
DESCRIPTION:            The seventh international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away. Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of the workshop instructor, they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening. So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!“Bonnie &amp; Clyde”. Instructor: Małgorzata Różalska (POL)In EnglishBonnie and Clyde - You and your partner. In crime. In story. In improv. No matter how many people play in a show, the base is the two-person scene. That’s perfect to tell all the stories in the world, with different dynamics between two characters. Through love. Hate. Secrets. Duties. Shrek and Donkey. Arya and the Hound. Jules and Vincent. Claire and Frank Underwood. Rick and Morty. Let’s explore the most popular dynamics between two characters.“The Dropthrough”. Instructor: Jeron Dewulf Leiva (BEL)In EnglishThe performers ask for a general theme, like for example “water” and start with a public brainstorm that leads to a scene inspired by the theme. Then they start a second scene inspired by the first scene. The players can get inspired by emotion, sentence or movement. They can always start a new scene, a group movement scene or a monologue. In 30 minutes the audience will see more or less 20 scenes, movements or monologues inspired by the theme and by former scenes.

SUMMARY:Rahel ja Mihkel (EST) - “Missed Calls” & Improteater IMPEERIUM (EST) – “On the writer’s exclusive texts”
DESCRIPTION:            Rahel ja Mihkel (EST) - “Missed Calls”In EstonianThere are two characters on the stage. Maybe they are childhood friends, lovers, relatives, good colleagues? Who exactly they are to each other, is the choice of the audience. However, it is certain that they are people from the modern world, to whom things always happen. Like to all of us. And the first thing you want to do is to share it with others. Whether through a picture, call or a text. Those two on stage, however, are destined to be unable to make contact with each other. Sounds familiar?Between them, Rahel and Mihkel have 18 years of shared love for improv. Rahel was Mihkel’s first improv teacher. Mihkel praises her until this day as a very good teacher and performer. However, not to Rahel herself, but to others. Rahel, on the other hand, has told everyone how she misses playing together with Mihkel. Well, everyone apart from Mihkel. Both being early middle-aged people, they will most likely focus on topics that concern others like them: am I successful enough; how to survive being stuck in the system; how to kill your boss? These are universal topics that could also interest other middle-aged people.Improteater IMPEERIUM (EST) – “On the writer’s exclusive texts”In EstonianThe Imperials will help a writer finish their new best-selling play! The show will start from the writer’s quill – the writer will be inspired by the audience and will write the first scene of the show in front of their eyes. The first characters are born, the location, the plot begins. The actors, however, see the text on stage for the first time and will start playing it out right away. We will find out where the story goes from there and how it ends on the spot as the rest is improvised.Improv theater IMPEERIUM (Empire) grew out of the first professional Estonian improv group in 2014. The members of the group are all professional actors, who in addition to being members of IMPEERIUM, are also part of drama groups in other Estonian theatres or work as freelancers in various theatre, television and film projects. In addition to actors, there are also musicians and lighting designers in the group, who help to spread the love for improv in Estonia. In improv, nobody knows what will happen, but everything is possible! The word “imperium” in Latin means “power”.Members of the troupe:Actors: Erki Aule, Merilin Kirbits, Maarika Mesipuu-Veebel, Maarius Pärn, Kati Ong, Rauno Kaibiainen, Mairi Tikerpalu, Tarvo Krall.Musicians: Madis Kreevan, Madis Jürgens ja Ragnar Toompuu.Lighting designer: Mario Saarik.  facebook.com/improimpeerium  improimpeerium.ee

LOCATION:Vene tn 6, Tallinn, Estonia
SUMMARY:Discovering Songs
DESCRIPTION:OK, so our scene has led us into the perfect moment for a song. Great. What happens next? What makes a great song?In this workshop we’ll look at how to create songs ‘organically’— by playing and experimenting, gradually discovering a brilliant theme and musical hook.We’ll look at:  what songs are about  how to explore and find a theme and perspective  how to know when you’ve found all that you need, and when you should changeThis session won’t require anyone to know the details of song structures or musical techniques. It’s therefore ideal to people who enjoy singing (maybe just in the shower), but haven’t done much musical improv. On the other hand, experienced improvisers can also find the novel approach interesting.Level: all levels but not complete improv beginners.Phil is an improviser from London, UK.

SUMMARY:Silence: Loud & Clear
DESCRIPTION:In life, some of the most profound, moving or hilarious experiences play out in total silence. In this workshop, we will learn to lean on that familiar human state - silence - on the stage, discovering it’s unique theatrical power.This workshop is not directed towards mime, or even necessarily physicality, but rather the dramatic and comedic impact of not speaking, and all the actions, realisations and stories that rush in to fill space when we’re brave enough to leave it empty. During the workshop, we will cycle through the myriad of ways silence can be utilised to make offers, ground scenes, heighten emotions, develop the game and connect with the audience.Level: all levels.Ella is an Australian actress and improviser who has been studying, performing and teaching theatre for over 12 years.

SUMMARY:A Simple Lovestory
DESCRIPTION:Bill Hicks said in his stand up something that many screenwriters agree on – that all we do is driven by two forces – love and fear. Because of love and fear we can cross our boundaries.In this workshop, we will focus on Normal People. Using the reality. Love, lack of love, bitterness, dreams, fears. On what hides inside of us and others, what drives us, and what we can do to get what we desire. And how to express your feelings on stage, so they won’t end at „Hi Honey”, five meters from each other.Why? Because the audience wants to engage, feel something, and not only laugh. And they feel when we touch the Truth. Because a simple love story has a bigger power than the battle of wizards at the top of Mount Everest.Level: intermediate.Małgorzata Różalska (Gosia/Róża) – improviser and teacher from the north of Poland.

It moves the actors to paint the scene with their bodies, creating images, compositions, landscapes, and environments. Whenever the music fades out, characters, plots, conversations and stories emerge, inspired by the images we have seen before. But the metronome of our lives keeps on ticking and it eventually dissolves every story and drives us again into physical scene pictures, which later inspire new stories… such is the nature of life and The Metronome.“Cloud Atlas”. Instructor: Aree Witoelar (IDN/NOR)In EnglishInspired by David Mitchell’s critically acclaimed novel, Cloud Atlas tells an epic tale of humanity in six separate storylines and six time eras. The performers will create such a piece, completely improvised from audience suggestions. Cloud Atlas is a perfect improv showpiece for big groups - hitting all different corners of stage picture, scenic tones, tempo, and style. Best for international mixed casts to represent a human voyage through culture and time.  Cloud Atlas is developed by Aree Witoelar and presented as a showcase for Impro Neuf International, Norway.

SUMMARY:Dan & Ella (FRA/ESP) - “Origami Swan” & Doris Likes Everything (FIN) - "Loser Circus"
DESCRIPTION:            Dan &amp; Ella (FRA/ESP) - “Origami Swan”In EnglishOrigami Swan is a show about the resonance of a relationship.In the Japanese art of origami, a single piece of paper contains a world of possibilities, with each fold guiding the material towards its final form. Yet even as it stands completed, the origami swan still holds within it the possibilities of what might have been. In Origami Swan, Ella Galt (BIG, Barcelona) and Dan Seyfried (La Carpe Haute, Strasbourg) present an intimate theatrical exploration of quantum multiverse theory, in which every choice you’ve ever made and never made exist in an unimaginably vast ensemble of parallel universes. As the reach of our possible worlds unfolds before us, we discover that the decisions we make are at once intensely powerful, and totally meaningless.Dan and Ella met in Barcelona, during BIG IF 2, a few years ago. They are both professional actors and improvisers in BIG (Barcelona, Spain) for Ella and in La Carpe Haute (Strasbourg, France) for Dan. They first played as a duo when a Polish festival (Podaj Wioslo, Gdansk 2018) challenged them to create a new format based on a name people on Facebook gave to them.

It’s a show that brings the heartwarming feel of a classic underdog story together with the rush and valour of the live acts that can only happen inside a circus ring. And a sneak peek, if you will, into the whimsical yet hard life that starts when the curtains are closed.Doris Likes Everything has nearly 30 years of combined improv experience and they are all keen on learning new skills, pushing themselves and each other to the next level and even beyond.Now they have already performed together in three different countries and Doris Likes Everything has formed itself into the perfect combination of dorkiness and coolness. They take their projects seriously but always with a heartful idiotism as a spice.  facebook.com/dorislikeseverything  instagram.com/dorislikeseverything

SUMMARY:Being a Dream Partner
DESCRIPTION:Be someone everyone wants to play with. We look at how to be an engaging, happy and fun partner. Good improvisers should be able to play with anyone - no matter if they are veterans or beginners, we can always elevate our partner and make them look good.

Soon enough, everyone will want you to be part of their team.Level: beginner-intermediate, but especially good for advanced players who miss the joy of playing with newbies.Aree Witoelar is the founder and artistic director of Impro Neuf International (INI) - Oslo’s first English improv comedy theatre and Norway’s largest improv community with over 500 members. He has been improvising since 2005 and is now with The Improv Speakeasy. He has performed in international festivals (Copenhagen, Bucharest, Amsterdam, Toronto) and in a dark alley, an underground bunker, and a Christmas Glühwein stand.Aree loves that there are many ways to do improv and believes that you have your own special blend. His improvisational style is a synthesis from masters of a variety of schools: Jay Sukow &amp; Andel Sudik (Second City), Will Hines (UCB), Jason Shotts &amp; Craig Cackowski (iO West), Katy Schutte (Maydays), Rafe Chase &amp; Tim Orr (BATS) and TJ Mannix (Magnet). His teaching philosophy is to help players find improv that brings joy and make bold choices within that style (see areewitoelar.com/testimonials). Aree runs an improv blog On Cloud Nine, inspired by what he observes in the Norwegian improv scene.  improvspeakeasy.com  facebook.com/improvspeakeasy  improneuf.no

SUMMARY:“Sõnadeta: Heliline teos!” & “Portmanteau”
DESCRIPTION:            The seventh international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away. Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of the workshop instructor, they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening. So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!“No Lyrics: The Sonic Piece!”. Instructor: Stacey Smith (USA)In EnglishWe sing when there are no words left to say. But what about when our lyrics are taken away? The show zooms in on sonic exploration and you will see how the performers will heighten their emotions to create musical pieces that have no words.“Portmanteau”. Instructor: Phil Whelans (GBR)In EnglishThree or four characters - some, none or all of whom know each other - are in a location (quite possibly one suggested by the audience). And there they stay - voluntarily or otherwise - for the whole show. And the interaction of these three or four could be a show in itself. But it isn’t.During the course of their time together, each character tells a story, and each story comes to life on stage, before we return to the central narrative - our characters in our location. The stories can be autobiographical, real, fantastical or none of the above. They can change the characters in the “meta” story and therefore feed that story. Or not. It’s all up for grabs. That’s right; it’s a Portmanteau.

SUMMARY:Troika (LVA/RUS) - “Journey” & ICC Theatre (DNK)
DESCRIPTION:            Troika (LVA/RUS) - “Journey”In EnglishWe all make choices every day, big or small, and they all take us on a journey.After getting a suggestion from the audience about a decision or choice they’ve made in their life (big or small) the actors are inspired to explore a character (or characters) stories.This decision can be the pivot point, or it can be the instigator, the beginning or the end, because it isn’t so much about the destination, it’s more about the journey.Troika was an idea that formed back at TILT in 2017 where Anna, Kaspars and Josh first met. After that clandestine meeting, they knew they had to perform together so they created Troika.They came up with the name Troika, meaning a Russian vehicle drawn by three horses, to represent how the trio of them met and bonded over their shared experiences.Troika, as a vehicle, allows these three improvisers to explore characters and choices they take while taking you on the journey with them.  facebook.com/ImprovComedyRiga  instagram.com/improvcomedyriga  facebook.com/improvgenerator  instagram.com/improvgeneratorICC Theatre (DNK)In EnglishICC Theatre is proud to be guesting TILT with four of their main stage performers.

SUMMARY:The Improv Speakeasy (NOR) - “Alice in Improvland” & 7 Women of Different Ages (POL)
DESCRIPTION:            The Improv Speakeasy (NOR) - “Alice in Improvland”Alice in Improvland is a damn serious show - that is, until Alice falls into a rabbit hole, then all bets are off! In this improvised spinoff of Lewis Carroll’s beloved children’s tale, we dive into the fantastical world of the most wonders of wonders, filled with the Queens of Hearts (maybe, we don’t know), the Mad Hatter (maybe), a smoking caterpillar (maybe) and grinning cats (yes please!). All the while dealing with the real consequences of Alice’s half day as a missing person. Where does reality end and fantasy begin? Audience gets to decide who Alice is and what kind of hole she falls into (be polite now).The Improv Speakeasy is the founding house team of Impro Neuf International, Oslo’s biggest improv theatre community. They love high culture and lowbrow humor: you can never guess if the next scene will be a Shakespearean tragedy or Family Guy. A curious mix of clowns, actors, hula hoopists, museum curators, doctors and neuroscientists, they aim for both heart and brain in one show. In the past five years, they have been the warden of Chateau Neuf, performing, hosting, teaching, and facilitating up-and-coming teams to power the explosive rise of Norwegian improv.Speakeasy is Aree Witoelar, Johanne Hofseth, Sverre Breian, Robin Sverd, Magnus Aasheim, Benedicte Alnæs, Eivind Hildre Spilling and Helene Holbæk. Between them, they have 50 years of improv experience and have performed in Denmark, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Germany and other places in Europe.  improvspeakeasy.com  facebook.com/improvspeakeasy  improneuf.no7 Women of Different Ages (POL)„Humor, strength, emotion and truth. A powerful combination that proves the importance of professional and conscious work.” / „Status” Magazine„The God created her, the Devil possessed,Forever she’s sinful, forever she’s saint,The good, and the bad, the tricky, sincereThe passion, despair, the smile, and the tear,And angel, and demon, and terror, and wonder,The peak over clouds, depth deep as can be,Beginning, the end, the woman - that’s me.” /Julian Tuwim„7 Women of Different Ages” is also a title of a documentary film by Krzysztof Kieślowski, as it is a direct inspiration for their show, in which actresses and women from the audience share particular moments of their lives - what they realized, what changed with years - and based on that they take you to improvised adventure told in several stories about being a women in XXI century.7 Women of Different Ages is a Polish-based group of improvisers, with a rich experience in their art, and various experience in life. In the cast, you may find not only an actress, and a film director, but also a mathematician, an interior designer and a Croatian philologist – and we’re just talking about their education here for start.  facebook.com/7womenofdifferentages  instagram.com/7women.improv
